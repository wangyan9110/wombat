# Typed client

[中文](README.md) | English

`@wombat/client` supplies one `UsageClient` to CLI and Web callers. Rust defines the business contracts; the client validates requests and results.

## Public entries

- `@wombat/client` exports `createUsageClient`, types, and `CoreError`. This entry loads no Node or terminal libraries.
- `@wombat/client/node` exports `createNodeClient` for the local core process and shared service.
- `@wombat/client/http` exports `createHttpClient` for the local Web host.
- `@wombat/client/locale` supplies presentation language support.

## Limits

The client exposes only generated operations. It provides no arbitrary shell execution or generic file writes. A cancelled wait does not prove that a write did not occur.
