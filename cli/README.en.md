# CLI entry

[中文](README.md) | English

`@wombat/cli` reads arguments and writes text or JSON results. It connects typed queries to the local core and starts Web on request.

## Public entries

- The package exports argument parsing and `runUsageCli`. `./format` exports text formatting.
- `api` lists local methods and schemas. `call` reads one bounded JSON request from stdin.
- `web` starts the local Web host. With no subcommand, the CLI prints usage text.

## Limits

JSON results use stdout; progress uses stderr. User decisions remain separate from check results. Unknown storage formats require explicit recovery; do not delete the original data.
