# Privacy and local data

[中文](privacy.md) | English

This page describes current privacy boundaries. See [core guide](../../core/README.en.md) for data directories and storage mechanisms.

Wombat needs no API key and reads local Codex rollout logs and the title index without modifying Codex logs, configuration, authentication, or installation. Live queries download a catalog from a fixed official OpenAI address by default when eligible usage lacks a price; explicit `prices update` also accesses the network. Requests contain no local logs, titles, paths, usage, or credentials, but the server can observe the connection IP and Wombat User-Agent. Downloads reject redirects and enforce timeout and response-size limits.

Set `WOMBAT_AUTO_PRICES=0` to disable automatic network access; `--cached`, fixed snapshots, and basic `refresh` do not automatically download prices. Explicit `prices update` is independent of that setting. Failures preserve usage and prices; see [pricing](pricing.en.md) for cooldowns and when updates take effect. Public software downloads for dependency installation are separate from product queries.

Derived indexes and snapshots retain token categories, pricing basis, source/conversation/turn identities, model and reasoning effort, time, project, native titles, and safe operation fields (tool name, file path, exit code, duration, MCP server/tool). Matching digests of determinate requests may be retained without raw parameters; they do not establish equal content or effects. Raw user messages, model text, complete command arguments, and tool output are excluded from snapshots and Node responses. Models, titles, paths, and names can still contain sensitive information and should not be shared indiscriminately.

Runtime review can transiently inspect bounded supported command, prompt and tool-output fields for risk patterns. It retains only finite safety labels, question-ID hashes, native call/process associations, response-presence flags and necessary lexical paths. No matched credential, masked credential, question, answer, command or output body is retained. Question-ID hashes identify source IDs, not content. Unknown or oversized fields preserve an explicit coverage gap.

Product data uses the system application data directory, overridable with WOMBAT_DATA_HOME. Files use atomic replacement. Unix creates private permissions; Windows inherits the data directory ACL, so use a private directory for the current user. Snapshots are not encrypted vaults. Basic scanning does not upload data, replay full text, or expose arbitrary execution. Explicit user sends to Codex transfer necessary targets, working directories, rules, and evidence versions; Codex manages subsequent model requests, execution, and recovery, as described in the [handoff guide](../guides/cli.en.md). Account reads do not copy credentials.

Source directories change continuously. Each refresh fixes the observed boundary of each file; partial failures, incomplete tails, and uncertain associations retain explicit status. Tool calls without exclusive token accounting do not receive invented costs. Official-standard API-equivalent cost is not a subscription invoice.

Tests and public source use synthetic fixtures only. Real-source smoke outputs must stay outside the repository. Unreviewed raw data, real conversations, and secrets must not enter tests or public material. Removing retired features does not remove historical user decisions, identity registrations, or recovery material.

Complete configuration under authorized roots is read, hashed and measured in memory only; derived caches contain safe metadata. Ignore/manual review records and language preferences live independently in user-v1 and survive index rebuilds. Records still contain object names/paths; users choose any external sharing.
