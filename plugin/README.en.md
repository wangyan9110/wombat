# Wombat plugin source

[中文](README.md) | English

This directory contains the user plugin source. One Skill serves Chinese and English. Codex manages installed plugins.

## Source entries

- `skills/wombat/SKILL.md` defines the user workflow.
- `hooks/` contains collection declarations.
- `scripts/` contains the POSIX collection bridge.
- `package.json` defines plugin metadata and required capabilities. The root manifest owns the version.

## Limits

Build the source before local plugin installation. Plugin installation, discovery, Hook trust, event receipt, and data readiness require separate evidence. Windows Hook collection remains unverified.
