# Startup and data readiness

Prefer the executable selected by the user, otherwise the managed user launcher `~/.local/bin/wombat` (`~/.local/bin/wombat.cmd` on Windows) when its `~/.local/lib/wombat/.managed-by-wombat` ownership marker exists, then the `wombat` launcher on PATH. A custom install prefix needs the user-selected path. Quote executable paths and pass arguments separately. Reuse the verified executable within this conversation. Check `--version --json` and only the relevant command's `--help` before using an unfamiliar capability; never infer support from version alone. Source worktrees can use the documented built entry with their Node runtime, but users need no Node or Rust installation.

No runtime: explain what is missing and refer to the project's installation instructions. Do not download, upgrade, enable plugins or read login credentials without the user's request. A remote host without local logs cannot answer local usage.

Start with the smallest query for the original task. Live usage queries discover supported sources, restore the index and sync automatically. Do not run `refresh` first unless a saved snapshot is requested. Configuration static checks can run while history is incomplete. Account reads do not wait for logs. Source roots and current project roots are distinct; never search the disk for projects or infer one from a path substring.

Inspect returned freshness and coverage:
- Complete current/fixed results support the requested conclusion and pinned drill-down.
- initialScan or provisional history: explain incomplete totals; existing tasks can be inspected, but no complete rankings or unused assertions.
- SYNC_PENDING without data: explain preparation and retry the same query with `--fresh` at most once. Normal queries wait roughly 2 seconds; fresh waits at most 10 seconds and may return SYNC_TIMEOUT. Preserve the original question for “continue”; a timeout does not stop shared scanning.
- syncing/stale with committed results: state the data time and answer what is supported; wait only if latest data is needed.
- failed/partial: retain usable facts, disclose failed sources or coverage.
- Completed empty results: distinguish absent supported logs from filters matching nothing.
- Expired view: reread the same scope, announce the version change. Unknown formats: preserve data and report, never clear or migrate.

`--cached` and fixed snapshots stay offline. Missing cache returns NO_SNAPSHOT, not zero usage. Set `WOMBAT_AUTO_PRICES=0` when offline is requested. Do not invent a readiness flag, database query, project percentage or ETA. The existing Web may display ongoing preparation; opening it must not create another index.
