# Local Web host

[中文](README.md) | English

`@wombat/web` connects authenticated local HTTP requests to `UsageClient`. The CLI supplies a Node client and manages host startup and shutdown.

## Public entry

`startWebHost(options)` returns the browser URL, origin, asynchronous `close()`, and restricted `openView(request)`.

## Limits

The host listens on loopback only. It does not support remote or hosted deployment. Requests require authentication and authorized source scope. A restart requires a new browser link.
